This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app).


This is a full-stack single-page application (SPA) built with Next.js, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, and Prisma (MySQL). It supports user authentication and post creation with admin moderation.

Features
User Registration & Login

Passwords are hashed and JWT tokens are used for secure authentication.

Create Posts

Users can publish posts with optional images.

Posts are saved in the database but not visible to others until approved.

Admin Approval System

Only the admin (by email) can access the /home admin panel.

Admin can view all pending posts and approve them with one click.

Post Listing

Only approved posts are shown on the public homepage.

Secure Actions

All post creation and deletion are protected by JWT-based authentication.


First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts) to automatically optimize and load [Geist](https://vercel.com/font), a new font family for Vercel.
